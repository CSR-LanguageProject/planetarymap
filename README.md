# Planetary Languages

A data-driven interactive visualization of the ways in which language endangerment is related to animal and plant endangerment.

## Introduction 

We are living in a time of unprecedented global change, the ice caps and melting, deforestation is rampant, and every XX seconds, a plant or animal goes extinct. These changes don't only affect the natural environment, but have come to affect human civilizations as well. The United Nations recently announced that by XX year, XX% of the world's languages will become extinct or moribund. In many cases, these languages were never written and cannot be recovered. It should come as no surprise that the majority of these languages were once spoken in areas that have since been most affected by these environmental changes. Areas that are have lost the most languages have also lost the most forest cover, the most animals, and have become urbanized at a faster rate than the rest of the world. It would be all too easy to assume that one leads to the other, that environment loss leads to language loss. And while this may be true, framing it in this way obscures the stories of the people and communities that spoke these languages. Frequently tied into notions of identity, community, and opportunity, the linguistic choices families make are often complicated. This project seeks to identify trends in language loss by examining the forces that drive it. Drawing on research from language endangerment, revitalization, and urbanization, this project weaves together the ways in which our changing planet affect local communities. 

### Research Questions
	
* How is environmental loss related to language loss?
	* What environmental factors are the biggest predictors of language endangerment?
* What economic, political, and environmental forces sway people to stop passing their language on?
	
### BEWARES

* This project runs the risk of sounding very paternalistic/idealistic/othering. How can this project be completed with respect. That is, language loss is very different from environmental loss. We are talking about humans, not other animals. Even making the comparison can come across as patronizing and exoticizing. People have VERY good reasons to encourage their children to learn a super language, move to the city, and lead a "better life." Community languages die out because of internal pressures as much as external. This project has the potential to sound like "rich (white) people should feel guilty for our over consumption, look at what we are doing to those poor black and brown people" - which delegitimizes and invalidates the reasons why a community would abandon their language for the opportunities promised by a super language. It also takes the agency away from rural communities, many of whom work very hard to send their children to the city to make a better life, even at the expense of their language and culture. 
	
## Project Plan

### Basic idea

* Many small maps showing areas of environmental (forest cover, endangered species, ground cover, urban areas, etc.) decline aligned to areas of language loss.

Option 1
* each map can be carried next to the language map where the correlations then appear
* The user can view these correlations individually or as a list.

Option 2
* One map that creates hotspots of all the metrics together
* Allow users to focus in on an area to see a timeline of change

### Design

* What should this look like?
* Interaction/colors/fonts/feel
* Images? 
* What is the experience of the user?

### Raw Materials

* UNESCO Data
* WDI World Bank Data
* Environmental Data

### Analysis

* Spatial correlations of change over time to language loss over time
* Find hotspots of language loss and of linguistic diversity

## Next Steps

1. Determine which metrics to use to compare to language loss
2. Find data for each metric
3. Create raster maps for each layer
4. Calculate respective correlations
